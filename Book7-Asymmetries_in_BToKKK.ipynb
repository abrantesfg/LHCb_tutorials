    "\n",
    "We certainly know that everything we see in the universe is made of matter, including ourselves. You might be familiar with the idea of matter, but what is **antimatter**? Antimatter is defined as matter composed of the antiparticles of the corresponding particles in \"ordinary\" matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you might have heard about this name in a sci-fi movie but it turns out that antimatter really exists! Even though we can't see it today in our universe, right after the Big Bang antimatter was produced. Antimatter is defined as matter composed of the *antiparticles* (or \"partners\") of the corresponding particles in \"ordinary\" matter, and can be thought of as matter with reversed charge, parity, and time, known as CPT reversal. For instance, let's take a proton (matter) and the antiproton (antimatter), they have the same mass, but opposite electric charge, and other differences in quantum numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furhtermore, antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an antiproton (the antiparticle of the proton) can form an antihydrogen atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will analyse particles containing the *b* (or beauty) quark and its antiparticles. You might be wondering where these *b* and anti *b* quarks come from... So now we are ready to explore where matter and antimatter come from! \n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after the Big Bang, lots of different particles were produced **including the b quark!** (Remember that the $b$ quark if one of the fundamental particles in our standard model!) However, these types of particles are not a constituent of the matter around us in the universe today. If you remember everything we see is made of protons, neutrons (which are made of *u* and *d* quarks) and electrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we are able to study these particles that we can't find in our universe is with particle colliders like the LHC. In these colliders *b* quarks and their antimatter counterparts, the anti-b quarks, are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important thing to know is that quarks are **not** observed on their own, instead they prefer to combine into composite particles forming what we call *hadrons*. Among the possibilities we have combinations of three quarks known as *baryons*. Note that we can also have combinations of three anti-quarks forming the antimatter baryons. Another possible combination is a pair of quark and an anti-quark, which are known as *mesons*. \n",
    "\n",
    "For examples of baryons we have protons and neutrons (most common baryons in the universe), with the corresponding anti-baryons anti-protons and anti-neutrons, and for mesons we have pions and kaons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Baryons and mesons are definitely the most popular combinations however we can also have combinations of four quarks (tetraquark) and five quarks (pentaquark)! \n",
    "\n",
    "All particles compsed of quarks and anti-quarks (baryons and mesons) are known as hadrons."

A $B^{-}$ is the anti-particle of the $B^{+}$, thus it is composed of and anti-*u* quark and a *b* quark and has electric charge of -1.\n",

We don't particularly mind where the $B^{+}$/$B^{-}$s themselves come from. All you need to know here is that each time the LHC smashes two protons together, they produce lots and lots of particles, some of which are $B^{+}$/$B^{-}$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "From theory, there are several decay routes but in this project we will be interested in the decays of the $B^{+}$ and $B^{-}$ into three charged kaons ($K^{+}$ or $K^{-}$).

On the left side we can see that the $B^{+}$ meson is composed of a $u$ and $\\bar{b}$ (anti-*b*) quarks and similarly we can see that the $K^{+}$ is composed of $u$ and $\\bar{s}$ and the $K^{-}$ is composed of $\\bar{u}$ and $s$. The lines connecting the quarks are called *quark lines*. Lastly, the $W^{+}$ boson is responsible for the interaction involved in this process. If you want to know more about the $W^{+}$ boson and the weak interaction click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction). For this project we won't need to go into details on the weak force, it's just nice to illustrate the detailed diagram.\n",

The events we see in our histogram are simulated $B^+ \\to K^+ K^+ K^-$ decays but in real life, determining the invariant mass of the B meson can be slightly more difficult. When we are analysing data collected by the LHCb, we can't control what particles are going to be produced, instead we collect everything, so our data samples not only have events that we are interested in (signal events) but also events that are not from the $B^+ \\to K^+ K^+ K^-$ decays (background events). And it's our job to apply some sort of requirements (cuts) to distinguish the interesting events from the others.\n",
