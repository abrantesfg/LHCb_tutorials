# LHCb_tutorials

In this repository you can find the materials for the LHCb Co-Creation Workshop.

This workshop will teach you about particle physics analysis, how can we use the data we have from the experiment and measure something with physical meaning.

If you have zero experience with programming and particle physics, there is no need to be worried! By following these codes you will gain the initial experience in some of the fundamentals tools you need that are used in experimental particle physics such as python, histograms, root files. We will build together the necessary knowledge you need by going through introductory notebooks some particle physics examples and, at the end, you will be able to develop yourself a code to analyse real LHCb data!

To start working with these codes, press the `binder` button below. By clicking, a new window will be opened and you can browse and select the notebook you want appearing in the left side of your screen.

With all that said, I hope you enjoy your first particle physics experience!
