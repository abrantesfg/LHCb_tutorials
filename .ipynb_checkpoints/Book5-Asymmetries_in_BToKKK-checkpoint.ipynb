    "In this project we will analyse particles containing the *b* (or beauty) quark and its anti-particles. You might be wondering where these *b* quarks come from...\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after the Big Bang, lots of different particles were produced **including the b quark!** However, these types of particles are not a constituent of the matter around us in the universe today. If you remember everything we see is made of protons, neutrons (which are made of *u* and *d* quarks) and electrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we are able to study these particles that we can't find in our universe is with particle colliders like the LHC. In these colliders *b* quarks and their antimatter counterparts, the anti-b quarks, are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important thing to know is that quarks are **not** observed on their own, instead they prefer to combine into composite particles forming what we call *hadrons*. Among the possibilities we have combinations of three quarks known as *baryons*. Note that we can also have combinations of three anti-quarks forming the antimatter baryons. Another possible combination is a pair of quark and an anti-quark, which are known as mesons. \n",
    "\n",
    "For examples of baryons we have protons and neutrons (most common baryons in the universe), with the corresponding anti-baryons anti-protons and anti-neutrons, and for mesons we have pions and kaons. \n",

All you need to know here is that each time the LHC smashes two protons together, they produce lots and lots of particles, some of which are $B^{+}$/$B^{-}$s.\n",

    "The brackets indicate how the particles are combined into the mesons. On the left side we can see that the $B^{+}$ meson is composed of a $u$ and $\\bar{b}$ (anti-*b*) quarks and similarly we can see that the $K^{+}$ is composed of $u$ and $\\bar{s}$ and the $K^{-}$ is composed of $\\bar{u}$ and $s$. The lines connecting the quarks are called *quark lines*. Lastly, the $W^{+}$ boson is responsible for the interaction involved in this process. If you want to know more about the $W^{+}$ boson and the weak interaction click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction). For this project we won't need to go into details on the weak force, it's just nice to illustrate the detailed diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this diagram corresponds to the $B^{+} \\to K^{+} K^{+} K^{-}$ decays, but you can draw the diagram for the anti-particle process by replacing every particle for its anti-particle (replace quark by its anti-quark, 'plus' sign with 'minus' sign and vice versa)\n"

    "So far, we've looked at what we call a simulation data to determine the invariant mass of the B meson. The events we see in our histogram are simulated $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ decays but in real life, determining the invariant mass of the B meson can be slightly more difficult. When we are analysing data collected by the LHCb, we can't control what particles are going to be produced, instead we collect everything, so our data samples not only have events that we are interested in (signal events) but also events that are not from the $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ decays (background events). And it's our job to apply some sort of requirements (cuts) to distinguish the interesting events from the others.\n",

    "The following steps are required now:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Firstly we need to filter out the data that is not from the $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ channel, or the antiparticle $B^- \\to K^+ K^+ K^-$\n",
    "* Then we can plot the histogram of the B meson mass for the real data and observe how different cuts affects the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data samples we are going to look have been filteres to select only events that are likely to have come from B+ or B- mesons decaying into three final state charged particles. In our case, we are interested when these particles are charged kaons ($K^+$ or $K^-$)."
