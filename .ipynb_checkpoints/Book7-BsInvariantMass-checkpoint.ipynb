    "The $B_{s}^{0}$ meson is composed of a $b$ quark and an $\\bar{s}$ antiquark (as we've seen in the Introduction to Particle Physics notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might recall, leptons can be either electrons or muons, or their antiparticles. **Flavour** just means whether a particle is an (anti)electron or a (anti)muon. We know the $B_{s}^{0}$ meson has charge zero, so, to conserve charge, the two leptons to which a single $B_{s}^{0}$ decays must have **opposite charges**. In our case, we are interested in the decay of $B_{s}^{0}$ to two muons ($B_{s}^{0} \\to \\mu^{-} \\mu^{+}$).\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to find $B_{s}^{0}$ mesons, but they don't live long enough to actually see with the detector itself. Instead, we have to **reconstruct** them from their decay products. We don't particularly mind where the $B_{s}^{0}$s themselves come from. All you need to know here is that each time the LHC smashes two protons together, they produce lots and lots of particles, some of which are $B_{s}^{0}$s.\n",

    "From theory, we know that there are several decay routes as you can see in [here](https://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?init=0&node=S086&home=MXXX046) but today we are interested in the particular decay route $B_{s}^{0} \\to \\mu^{-} \\mu^{+}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have noticed, this decay is not very easy to observe. In comparison with other possible routes, this particular decay happens less frequently and because of that we can call this a **rare decay**.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this option, a random $B_{s}^{0}$ emerges from the collision aftermath in the LHC (we don't care how) can decay directly to two muons with opposite charge. This means a muon and an antimuon. The decay happens at the vertex below, marked by a dot. We denote a lepton by the letter $\\mu^{+}$. Conventionally, antiparticles are shown with a bar on top, so an antilepton is $\\mu^{-}$.\n",
