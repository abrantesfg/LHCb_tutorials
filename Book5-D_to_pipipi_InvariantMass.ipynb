When dealing with gaussian functions, two very important features are the mean value of the function, $\\mu$, and the width, $\\sigma$. The $\\mu$ is the value which our curve is cetered at, in this case, the gaussian peak is centered at zero. The $\\sigma$ is the width of the distrbution, in this case we can see that the distribution is basically over before -2 and after 2. So the total width here is 1.\n",
