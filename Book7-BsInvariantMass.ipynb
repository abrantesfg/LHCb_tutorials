We know the $B_{s}^{0}$ meson has charge zero, so, to conserve charge, the two leptons to which a single $B_{s}^{0}$ decays must have **opposite charges**. In our case, we are interested in the decay of $B_{s}^{0}$ to two muons ($B_{s}^{0} \\to \\mu^{-} \\mu^{+}$).\n",

    "We have a theory that a more complicated interaction occurs between a quark, $q$, and an antiquark, $\\bar{q}$. We think that they come towards each other, and quickly exchange a particle (the vertical line below). When this happens, the quark and antiquarks turn into $Z^0$s, which then decay themselves, exactly as in the last analysis. Notice that the part of the Feynman diagram within the box is exactly the same as the diagram above!\n",

You may notice that it looks pretty close to what we had before - that's because there are lots and lots of Z decays that happen in the detector. If you looked closely enough, you would be able to tell that there are other colours stacked there in the histogram, but the slices are so thin that you can't see them.\n",
