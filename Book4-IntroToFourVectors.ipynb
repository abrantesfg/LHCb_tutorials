    "We show decays with a [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram), which (for our purposes) we can think of a diagram of the interaction itself, where time goes from left to right. This is not strictly true, but it will suffice for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each particle is a single line, and you can think of the vertical axis as space, so in this example we have an electron $e^-$ and its antiparticle, a positron, $e^+$, moving towards each other in space, annihilating each other, producing a photon ($\\gamma$) and then that photon decays to two muons.\n",

    "You may have noticed that the arrow for the positron is the wrong way round for the process which we have just described. By convention, the arrow for an antiparticle is reversed. (If you really want to know, it's because an antiparticle can be thought of as a particle moving backwards in time - something which we will not go into here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we say that energy and momentum must be conserved at each vertex in the Feynman diagram. $\\vec{p}^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{before} = \\vec{p}^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{after}$, and $E^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{before} =E^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{after}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The $\\mu$ is just an arbitrary index, starting at zero, so $P^0 = E/c$, $P^1 = p_1 = p_x$, $P^2 = p_2 = p_y$, $P^3 = p_3 = p_z$. However, we make sure to write it to make it clear that this is no ordinary spatial vector that we're dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add and subtract these four-vectors like any other vector with four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P^\\nu_{e^+} + P^\\nu_{e^-} = (E_{e^+} + E_{e^-}, \\vec{p}_{e^+} + \\vec{p}_{e^-}) = P^\\nu_\\mathrm{tot}$$\n",

The $m$ in this is called its invariant mass. Clearly, you can quite easily construct $m$ from the components of the 4-vector. \n",

    "One last thing - we can just pick a system of units in which $c = 1$. We basically do this by redefining what our SI units are. Imagine that we measured distances in pirate-wizards, which we define to be equal to $299 792 458$ metres. Let's keep measuring times in seconds, though. You, then are about $6\\times 10^{-9}$ pirate-wizards tall.\n",

    "Let's then define the unit of energy as 1 GeV - one gigaelectronvolt. What does that make our unit of mass? Now, we know that the units still have to match up dimensionally, and we know that $1 kg = 1 Joule /c^2$, so let's measure mass in $eV /c^2$. Similarly, let's measure momentum in $eV/c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can measure some particle A to have a mass of $3 GeV/c^2$, an energy of $5 GeV/c^2$, and a momentum of $4 GeV/c$. The advantage of setting $c=1$ is that we can throw out all of those extra $c$s. That means we can measure everything in units  of $GeV$! So, our particle A just has $m=3$, $E=5$, and $p=4$. Of course, you can't do dimensional analysis any more, but it makes a lot of things easier - trust me. For one thing, our mass equation turns out to be pretty simple: $m = \\sqrt{E^2 - p^2}$. \n",
