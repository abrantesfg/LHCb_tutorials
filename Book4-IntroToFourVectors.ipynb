    "We show decays with a [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram), which (for our purposes) we can think of a diagram of the interaction itself, where time goes from left to right. This is not strictly true, but it will suffice for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each particle is a single line, and you can think of the vertical axis as space, so in this example we have an electron $e^-$ and its antiparticle, a positron, $e^+$, moving towards each other in space, annihilating each other, producing a photon ($\\gamma$) and then that photon decays to two muons.\n",

    "Now, we say that energy and momentum must be conserved at each vertex in the Feynman diagram. $\\vec{p}^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{before} = \\vec{p}^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{after}$, and $E^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{before} =E^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{after}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "P has four components so, starting at zero, $P^0 = E/c$, $P^1 = p_1 = p_x$, $P^2 = p_2 = p_y$, $P^3 = p_3 = p_z$. However, we make sure to write it to make it clear that this is no ordinary spatial vector that we're dealing with.\n",

    "We can add and subtract these four-vectors like any other vector with four components:\n",

The $m$ in this is called its invariant mass. Clearly, you can quite easily construct $m$ from the components of the 4-vector. \n",

    "One last thing - we can just pick a system of units in which $c = 1$. We basically do this by redefining what our SI units are. Imagine that we measured distances in pirate-wizards, which we define to be equal to $299 792 458$ metres. Let's keep measuring times in seconds, though.

    "Let's then define the unit of energy as 1 GeV - one gigaelectronvolt. What does that make our unit of mass? Now, we know that the units still have to match up dimensionally, and we know that $1 kg = 1 Joule /c^2$, so let's measure mass in $eV /c^2$. Similarly, let's measure momentum in $eV/c$.\n",

    "So, we can measure some particle A to have a mass of $3 GeV/c^2$, an energy of $5 GeV/c^2$, and a momentum of $4 GeV/c$. The advantage of setting $c=1$ is that we can throw out all of those extra $c$'s. That means we can measure everything in units  of $GeV$! So, our particle A just has $m=3GeV$, $E=5GeV$, and $p=4GeV$. Now mass, energy and momentum have the same dimensions, it makes a lot of things easier - trust me. For one thing, our mass equation turns out to be pretty simple: $m = \\sqrt{E^2 - p^2}$. \n",
