So what should we use for the value of the velocity in the position's update formula?  If we use the velocity at the beginning of a step, then the displacement will be underestimated (because the position equation does not know that the cart is accelerating, and thereby traveling further per unit time by the end of the step).  If we use the velocity at the end, we will overestimate the displacement (because the cart at the end of a step is moving further per unit time than it did at the beginning).  We must make a choice here, and either choice incurs an _error_.  We choose to take the velocity at the end.  Therefore here is the order of calculations for each time step:\n",
