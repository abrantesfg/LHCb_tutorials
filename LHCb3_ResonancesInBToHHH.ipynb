    "## What is a Dalitz plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dalitz plot is a two-dimensional representation of the phase-space of the decay process. It was invented by Richard Dalitz (1925-2006). You might be wondering now what is a phase-space...\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, let's look at the decay process we are going to study, $B^+ \\to K^+ K^+ K^-$. This decay can either proceed directly into the three-body final state as shown in the left-hand side figure, or it can happen via an intermediate particle, *R* (we usually call this state a **resonance**). In our case, $B^+ \\to K^+ K^+ K^-$ can proceed through the decay $B^+ \\to K^+ R$, then this resonance *R* can decay to $R \\to K^+ K^-$. What usually happens is that we could have several possible resonant states being produced in the decay process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can see an example of a Dalitz plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine that the LHC is recording lots of data, and for each event we could end up with one of the possible resonant states. Each event is a dot in our Dalitz plot. Therefore, over a huge amount of data (large statistics), we will have lots of dots creating regions more populated and regions less populated in our Dalitz plot. These bands help us understand a low of the decay process. For instance, we could find a resonance mass and spin by just looking at the band corresponding to it! So, Dalitz plots can be used to identify these resonances which are visible bands on the Dalitz plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we need to produce a Dalitz plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "The kinematics of a three-body decay can be fully described using only two variables. The energies and momenta of the three kaons are not independent of each other as they all come from the decay of a B meson and energy and momentum are conserved. The axes of the plots conventionally are the squared invariant masses of two pairs of the decay products. It is a 2D plot, the x and y axes are both squared masses and the density of points in the plot shows the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our decay $B^+ \\to K^+_1 K^+_2 K^−_3$, where we have numbered the kaons 1,2,3 to distinguish them. We can calculate the invariant mass of three possible combinations that could correspond to intermediate resonances $R_1 \\to K^+_1 K^+_2$, $R_2 \\to K^+_1 K^-_3$, and $R_3 \\to K^+_3 K^-_3$."

    "## B mesons\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be studying the decays of the $B^{+}$ and $B^{-}$ mesons. A $B^{+}$ is a mesons composed of an *u* (up) quark and an anti-*b* (beauty) quark and has electric charg of +1. A $B^{-}$ is the anti-particle of the $B^{+}$, thus it is composed of and anti-*u* quark and a *b* quark and has electric charge of -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bpth $B^{+}$ and $B^{-}$ mesons don't live long enough to actually see with the detector itself. Instead, we have to reconstruct them from their decay products. We don't particularly mind where the $B^{+}$/$B^{-}$s themselves come from. All you need to know here is that each time the LHC smashes two protons together, they produce lots and lots of particles, some of which are $B^{+}$/$B^{-}$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "From theory, there are several decay routes but in this project we will be interested in the decays of the $B^{+}$ and $B^{-}$ into three charged kaons ($K^{+}$ or $K^{-}$). The $K^{+}$ is a meson composed of a *u* quark and an anti-*s* quark, and has +1 unit of charge. The $K^{-}$ is its anti-particle.\n",

    "## $B^{+} \\to K^{+} K^{+} K^{-}$ Feyman diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, particle physicists usually likes diagrams to represent the decay process. Here we have the Feynman diagram of the decay we are interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "<CENTER><img src=\"./images/BtoKKK.png\" style=\"width:50%\"></CENTER>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this image we have on the left side our $B^{+}$ particle, which will decay into the three kaons shown on the right side. Remember that time flows from left to right!\n",
    "\n",
    "The brackets indicate how the particles are combined into the mesons. On the left side we can see that the $B^{+}$ meson is composed of a $u$ and $\\bar{b}$ (anti-*b*) quarks and similarly we can see that the $K^{+}$ is composed of $u$ and $\\bar{s}$ and the $K^{-}$ is composed of $\\bar{u}$ and $s$. The lines connecting the quarks are called *quark lines*. Lastly, the $W^{+}$ boson is responsible for the interaction involved in this process. If you want to know more about the $W^{+}$ boson and the weak interaction click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction). For this project we won't need to go into details on the weak force, it's just nice to illustrate the detailed diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this diagram corresponds to the $B^{+} \\to K^{+} K^{+} K^{-}$ decays, but you can draw the diagram for the anti-particle process by replacing every particle for its anti-particle (replace quark by its anti-quark, 'plus' sign with 'minus' sign and vice versa)\n"

    "So far, we've looked at what we call a simulation data to obtain the Dalitz plot of the $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ decay. The events we see in our Dalitz plot are simulated $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ decays but in real life, determining the Dalitz plot can be way more interesting, with the bands we've been discussing. Before looking at the data Dalitz plot, we need one additional step. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we are analysing data collected by the LHCb, we can't control what particles are going to be produced, instead we collect everything, so our data samples not only have events that we are interested in (signal events) but also events that are not from the $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ decays (background events). And it's our job to apply some sort of requirements (cuts) to distinguish the interesting events from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are required now:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Firstly we need to filter out the data that is not from the $B^+ \\to K^- K^- K^+$ channel, or the antiparticle $B^- \\to K^+ K^+ K^-$\n",
    "* Then we can plot the histogram of the B meson mass for the real data and observe how different cuts affects the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data samples we are going to look have been filteres to select only events that are likely to have come from B+ or B- mesons decaying into three final state charged particles. In our case, we are interested when these particles are charged kaons ($K^+$ or $K^-$)."

Your resonances R13 and R23 are both composed of the same particle types, $K^+ K-$, and hence have the same distributions. It is useful to impose an ordering which distinguishes the resonances. We can call the resonances $R_{Low}$ and $R_{High}$. In each event $R_{Low}$ is the resonance with the lower mass and the other corresponds to the higher mass combination of kaons. You can now use the mass of these ordered resonances as your Dalitz plot variables, thus effectively \"folding\" your Dalitz plot so that one axis always has a higher value than the other.\n",

    "Hint: Ordered Dalitz plot - You can find the maximum of the mass of $R_{Low}$ vs $R_{High}$ elementwise on one axis, and the minimum of on the other. You can use `numpy.min(a,b)` and `numpy.max(a,b)` to perform elementwise comparisons between two arrays a and b and return one array filled by either the individual min/max element from the elementwise comparisons."
