    "Being able to code is an essential skill for a Particle Physicist (or any scientist, for that matter).  Our datasets are simply too large to process without the assistance of computers!  An LHCb Physicist typically uses some combination of the C++ and Python programming languages to accomplish everything from simulating proton-proton collisions to searching for Higgs bosons.\n",
    "\n",
    "As being code-literate is a prerequisite to analysing LHCb data, we will in this notebook review some of the basics of coding in Python.  We will do this by presenting a diluted and interactive version of the tutorial of the [official Python documentation][PyTutorial].  For more information on any topic, let the official Python documentation be your first port of call.  We will link to specific parts of the tutorial as we go along.\n",
